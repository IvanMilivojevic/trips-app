This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It includes starting setup with [TypeScript template with preconfigured Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/cra-guide#typescript-template).

## Running the Project

To install dependencies and prepare

### `npm install`

To run the development server:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the project.

## Setup requirements, development/testing environment

This configuration/setup was used for development/testing:

- Windows 11
- Node 18.18.0
- git version 2.40.1.windows.1
- IDE - Visual Studio Code 1.82.2

Several extensions can be installed to help with development, testing and checking for errors

- ESLint
- GitLens
- Import Cost
- Prettier

## Libraries/packages used

- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) - Mock Service Worker - Used for mocking API calls and sending back JSON response
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatting

## Additional Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
